Made a Productivity App to be productive for a bit :)

The app consists of 3 pages: A home page, a timer page and a To-Do list page. Each page can be accessed from the others and will have funtionalities as follows:

### Home Page 
<ul><li> Toggle to switch between day and night</li>
<li>Buttons going to the To-Do page and the Timer page</li></ul>

### Timer Page
<ul><li>Default timers of:
<ul><li> Work (25 minutes) </li><li>Break (5 minutes)</li></ul></li>
<li>Custom Timer</li>
<li>Buttons going to Home and To-Do page
</ul>

### To-Do List Page
<ul>
<li> Add task </li>
<li> Edit task</li>
<li> Mark task as done</li>
<li> Delete task </li>
<li> Star a task </li>
<li> Buttons to Home and Timer page </li>
</ul>
<br>Tasks are stored in localStorage 

## How to use:
There are two ways you could use the app:
<ol> <li>On cmd run the following, it will run the app in development mode via Electron <br>
  
```
git clone https://github.com/gitsika119/sidequesting.git
cd sidequesting
npm install
npm start 
```
</li>
<li>
  (Better way) Download installer from Releases, install and run it (Will need to click more info/ run anyway because I'm an unidentified publisher). The app will install and run. After that you can delete the installer and search up the app and run it :)
</li><br></ol>
